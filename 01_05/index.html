        Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how
        many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
        getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
        be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
        several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
        though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her
        knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
        practice to say it over)...

      Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny
      it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads
      downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there was no
      one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word)
      “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you
      know.

      Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
      talking again...when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
      of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
