          Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how
          many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be
          getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
          be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt
          several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
          though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her
          knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
          practice to say it over)...

          Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the
          earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk
          with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather
          glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all
          the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
          country is, you know.

        <h2>The last of the three items</h2>
        <p>
          Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
          talking again...when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
          of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
