      <h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonder how
        many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be getting
        somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four
        thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt several
        things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
        was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there
        was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it
        over)...
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right through the
        earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with
        their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad
        there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the
        right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country
        is, you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
        talking again...when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap
        of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
